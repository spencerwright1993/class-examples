        <h2>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Spencer Wright, and I am currently attending the Helio Training bootcamp in Salt Lake City for Full Stack Web
            Development. Im 26 years old, and Im currently working two jobs to pay my way through school. Im extremely excited to start 
            my career in web development. I've lived in Salt Lake City my whole life, and I currently live in Draper, Utah. I'm always 
            staying busy in life. Whether it be working, going to the gym, or hanging out with my friends, you can always find me doing 
            something to keep myself busy.
        </p>

                <li>Traveling to Foreign Countries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My favorite thing to do when the weather is nice is longboard. Ive been longboarding for about 4 years now, and it is one of the
                best things, in my opinion, to do during the summer. When Im not longboarding you can catch me at the gym usually. And if Im not there
                then you can find me grabbing drinks with my friends.
